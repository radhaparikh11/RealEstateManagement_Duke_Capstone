Forecast best nightly rent to charge for each of the client’s 244 Watershed properties - 
the rent that maximizes forecast annual revenues for each of those properties.


First, creating a predictive model – 
using a best-fit line on historical data for properties comparable to Watershed's – 
that relates nightly rents to forecast occupancy rates.

Second, using the predictive model you have created, 
along with the MS Excel “Solver” optimization tool, to find, 
for each individual property separately, the nightly rent that maximizes its forecast total revenues – 
the product of the optimum nightly rent and its associated occupancy rate.
